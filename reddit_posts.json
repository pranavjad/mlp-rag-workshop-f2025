For the new freshmen, good luck.\n\nI figured now is a good of a time as any to go over a bunch of random stuff and a few reminders. First of all, please for the love of god think about what you are going to post before you do it. Some (recent) examples of stuff that is frowned upon:\n\n1) Posting internal Purdue documents that will get me a Mod Mail from Purdue  \n2) Unredacted letters that have your full legal name  \n3) Your full block schedule that details where and when you will be different places  \n4) Your exact dorm assignments (I haven't seen this one in a while but it is a good one)\n\nPlease don't turn this into the [War Thunder forums](https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/classified-data-once-again-leaked-on-war-thunder-forums/). \n\n# For the new freshman some helpful hints:\n\n1) Get involved in different things. Your roommate will not appreciate you sitting in your dorm all day. It's also good for the resume.  \n2) Walk your schedule before the Monday classes start. It will help you realized how screwed (or not) you are frantically running from the airport to Armstrong with busses that seem to be about as reliable as a McDonald's Ice Cream Machine.  \n3) No one knows what's going on so you aren't alone in that. Just make the best of it.  \n4) Make sure everyone knows that you are a sophomore by credit. Trust me, everyone loves to hear it and you are super special.\n\n# For all club presidents/representatives:\n\nWe are going to try something new-ish this year. We are returning the callout megathread. This will be posted Monday-ish. I am going to see if there is a way I can allow that post to have images for all your fliers and stuff. The goal of this is to both declutter the normally numerous club post and also allow people to easily search one thread. If it sucks and doesn't work then we will just revert to the old way. If you have any concerns or questions about this speak now or forever hold your peace.",

Those are your classes that you are currently taking right now (2k1, 264, etc.). I would often rally a bunch of people to review for exam together, or even just begin commiserating together about any class you don\u2019t like. The study group thing is especially effective before an exam. You can also make plans to go to labs with your friends to also kill two birds with one stone. It\u2019s definitely easier to build those strong bonds in ECE rather than outside your major, because hanging out can often mean studying together.\n\nMaybe in class you can ask questions on certain topics (\u201cHow did you get this part of the lab to work?\u201d) and maybe build up from there. You can think of it as FYE round 2, since you all are still technically still starting the ECE curriculum.\n\nJoining clubs based on ECE like ECESS can also help, this is something I regret not doing. Overall your friend groups will shift through college, so don\u2019t be afraid or overwhelmed if you notice your group changing. I\u2019m still meeting new friends in my classes now!\n\nLet me know if you ever want to talk about it, I may have formatted this weirdly but I truly hope this helps, good luck!",

In my personal experience (2 distance masters, one from Purdue WL, one from Umich Ann Arbor and working on another from UMich Ann Arbor), they don\u2019t care about online degrees if they\u2019re from reputable / real schools - and that is a stretch. The diplomas all say the same thing. People legitimately ask me how I had the time to take leave from work for years at a time to finish my degrees(I didn\u2019t - but they have no idea I guess?). \n3. Networking is different for sure. You need to make a lot more effort to keep in touch with people you do group work with, but I\u2019ve met really good people that I keep in touch with regularly from my online masters programs. \n4. Depends on what your investment is and what you deem \u201cworth it\u201d. Are you going for a promotion? New job? Slightly different job path? Completely different industry?

I think the online masters is comparable to the on-campus programs. Two of the three classes I am taking this semester are delivered on-campus and remote together by the same professor, which means you can join the lectures on zoom synchronously if you want. The lectures are also recorded so you can watch asynchronously as well. They hold both in-person and online office hours. I would say the quality of the content varies depending on the professor. The three courses I am taking now, the professors are very good and involved with the students. Although they are a LOT of work, I am happy with the quality of instruction I am receiving. The class I took over the summer did not seem like the professor was very hands-on (the lectures were recorded from a previous semester), but it was an easy A to get me started on the program which I was okay with.\n\nThe degree will not say the program was delivered on-campus or remote, they will look the same. If someone asks you could specify, but if you really want you could probably get away with saying it was in-person.\n\nIt does feel like I am missing out on a bit of networking, but I have been going to office hours held by the professors and been active on Piazza. I'm hoping if I go to enough office hours the professors will know my name enough to be willing to write a recommendation letter for me. I am not currently in a research program or project, but you could definitely look at what kinds of projects professors are working on and send out some emails asking if you could be a part of it. I think that with enough people working on their masters as full-time professionals and doing school on the side, working on a research project is not a necessity to stand out like it was in undergrad, but it could be worth the time. I think especially in MSAI, you don't need to be on-campus to be a part of a research project.\n\nWhether the investment is worth it is up to you. I went to Purdue for a bachelors in Computer Engineering and tried to go into software but couldn't find a job, so I decided to go back for a masters in semiconductors because that's what I've wanted to do in the first place. If I get a job in the semiconductor industry with this degree, it will be worth it. To my knowledge, the software industry is still on a decline especially for new grads, so I'm not sure how much the masters will help for you.",

I don\u2019t want to blame everything on Covid, but talking with grad students and some friends who have been here longer than me, there was a pretty noticeable shift over the pandemic and lockdowns in campus culture and general sociability. Could just be the people I float around, but whatever. \n\nCollege is a hard adjustment. You\u2019re not alone in going through it, and with time you\u2019ll carve out a place for yourself here. Everyone is working on coming into a more realized version of themselves here. Whatever that\u2019s going to be, and it will be different for everyone.\n\nI\u2019m not in a co-op, so I can\u2019t offer much advice there, but I know how grades can feel. My sophomore year I took Organic Chemistry. My highest exam grade was a 48%, my lowest a 26%. I\u2019ve since passed the class, but the most important lesson I learned from it was that grades don\u2019t define who you are. Having a pretty GPA can be nice, but for the vast majority of people that\u2019s not gonna matter all that much. Your worth is not defined by how well you can do on an exam. Take a deep breath. You will get through this.\n\nClubs are great for finding community, but you have to find one that\u2019s a good fit, just like anything else. If you\u2019re not meshing with the ones you\u2019re part of right now, take a look at others. There are so many clubs on campus, many dedicated to goofy things. I tried to be in so many freshman year and now I check out a few meetings a semester for each of my favorites. It\u2019s what works for me, and you\u2019ll find what works for you soon enough as well.",

I am an extreme introvert and have always had a hard time making friends and college only made that seem worse. But getting involved, either by clubs or even finding a job on campus helps A LOT! i found my home at my job and made so many friends. It also has helped me have to stay on campus instead of just wishing I was home. i work weekends so instead of being bored on campus thinking I could be at home, I spend my weekend busting ass at work and it makes me forget about wanting to be home. It takes time to get used to campus and sometimes it feels like people are getting used to it faster than you but it will happen. It took me til spring break of my freshman year to feel okay with being here. People makes jokes about business degrees and how it\u2019s easy and blah blah but Purdue\u2019s business is starting to become of the best in the states. To transfer into Purdue\u2019s business program, you need a 3.5. Give yourself credit, Purdue choose you and wants you here.

But as far as I can tell, the MSAI just doesn't have opportunities for that: the research centers seem to only have PhD students as affiliates, there is no thesis options, and there isn't even an independent study option! The admissions person basically told me that I could talk to faculty to try to get on their projects, but I know that's pretty unlikely if I'm an online student and including MS students is outside the norm.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this program?

I can\u2019t sleep and can\u2019t stop thinking about him. \n\nfrom what else I got from his note was that he started to think he was weird for having and being too attached to certain hobbies and interests.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the counselors\u2019 fault at all, I think they just don\u2019t have enough resources to go around so they can only go so deep per person. That being said, I think it is scary that they refuse to publicize the suicide rates despite recording them, at least according to [The Exponent](https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/behind-the-numbers-why-have-there-been-so-many-suicides-near-campus-lately/article_7f746156-f6a9-11ee-a260-67537f3c1b2d.html). If you are someone or know someone who needs mental health help, I\u2019d seriously recommend going to a therapist individually. CAPS is just going to give you the generic advice you\u2019ll find online and not really sit down and be able to give individualized care.",

    "body": "I think I've reached a point in which my mental health is at the edge of collapsing completely, I don't really like posting negative stuff and I don't like burdening people with my issues, but honestly I just hope to find comfort in letting it all out and maybe my experience may help as a warning for someone trying to follow my steps (so they can do it better).\n\nFor a bit of context: I'm an international student who came to the U.S. to study industrial engineering at one of the top engineering schools. Same as everyone here, I had to sacrifice a lot of time and put a lot of effort to get into Purdue, even more since I'm an international student, and that seemed reasonable. I hoped to get a better education and find better opportunities than back home, and I've had many great experiences that I wouldn't have been capable of living without being here, I don't regret that.\n\nHowever, things are bad for internationals, I can't help but live with fear of what new policy will appear that will be yet another obstacle for my professional life. Ever since I got here, things for people who are not U.S. citizens have been getting worse. I'm scared of being racially profiled and targeted, I don't feel like I'm wanted or worth something here, and all hopes of getting internships have banished since recruiters are basically scared of sponsoring internationals at all due to how policies have been changing.\n\nIt just amazes me how I can work my ass off, give up a long term relationship due to long distance so I can lock in here, leave my friends and family from back home and all the life I knew before, do more than the average engineering student to stand out (thus having less time for myself and having intense stress and anxiety all the time due to everything that I have to do), and it doesn't matter.\n\nI've had almost 18 credits each semester (only 17 in my first one), I didn't get here with a single AP credit but I'm planning to graduate in 3.5 years, I am doing written research alone (but my mentors are the most uninspiring people on Earth, since they just look at me like I'm always doing something wrong and never give me any motivating feedback about my work), I took like 4 freaking engineering certifications in a year and I've taken summer classes at Purdue on top of that.\n\nThat may sound really good, but I feel like I still haven't done anything worthwhile (impostor syndrome maybe?) and I have international friends far more skilled than me, that have done more impressive stuff, and they aren't having any luck with internships either. I feel like all of this is sucking the life out of me and that I've lost balance, only going to the gym gives me a boost of serotonin and I'm starting to think that my mental health is not going to improve at all, should I stop?\n\nI've considered just transferring to another country or back home, I feel like there is not much hope for me if I choose to stay here, but I don't want to give up. I can manage my classes and the research too, at least well enough to not fail, but I feel like I'm losing the ability to do even that. That's how worrying my mental state is. I'm a bad thing away from crashing out or maybe I already did, but I think the only thing I can do is keep up with my responsibilities for now and maybe slow down after this semester.\n\nThank you for reading my crash out post, I'd appreciate any advice or words of motivation. Or just anyone saying that I'm forgetting that Purdue GRIT and that I need to lock the f\\*ck in, LMAO.",

Every single summer when I come back from home (I\u2019m not international, but OOS) I get a shock and mental health plummets until I get into the groove of things. I can\u2019t imagine the shock coming from a different country.\n\nSecond, you say that you\u2019re always comparing yourself to your friends and their achievements. We are at a crazy top engineering school- everywhere you go there are going to be people who seem more qualified than you, but here\u2019s the thing. Cheesy, but comparison IS the thief of joy. You\u2019ve doing great things and accomplished so much here already and you should be proud of yourself. If anything, if you feel less \u201cgifted\u201d than them you should be prouder, because you put in more work on the daily than they do. \n\nThird, the job market and the world. As for the job market, it sucks over here, and West Lafayette always has their positions filled. I don\u2019t know your situation, but if you can go home for a summer and look for an internship there that\u2019d be a great way to get the foot in the door. Also, Indy is about an hour and a half away, and they have lots of internships over there for any major. My capstone requires one and I\u2019m doing mine in Indy. As for the state of the world, it does suck. I think, though, that as long as you don\u2019t get in trouble with the law or university that there are SO many international students in the US giving big universities money that you won\u2019t be forced to leave this country. Both sides LOVE taking money and universities and students would fight (for different reasons) to keep international students protected. \n\nYou might need a break semester, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that especially with such a difficult major. You\u2019ve burnt yourself out, and it sounds like you\u2019re most of the way through. I\u2019d make an appointment to see the associate dean Dr. Evans, I\u2019ve had many meetings with her and she is wonderful at discussing mental health, options you have available, and talking through if college & this college is right for you in this moment.\n\nYou are not alone, and you are so very strong to be able to admit that you need help. The best thing I can recommend to you is to go see Dr. Evans to discuss your situation because holy crap she is one of the best humans here on campus.",

I would encourage you to continue trying for internships and dont get your hopes down if you dont land anything right now. \n\nI dont know how you feel about trying to get internships in your home country but that might be an option. Also, if you find yourself at a point where you can\u2019t find employment in the US after graduation, there is no harm going to your home country, get a job (I know not ideal) and continue to apply to positions internationally. I have seen multiple administrations come in with different policies/agendas etc. but at a certain point things will move back to a more centrist view once countries realize that losing out on \u201cbright minds\u201d is not in the best interest of the country.  \n\nIn life there are going to be situations that are out of your control, its ok to be disappointed but I would encourage you do the best you can and leave the rest to the \u201chigher powers\u201d AND keep your CHIN UP!",

The unit is quite spacious, and it's split into two 2b1b suites separated by a common kitchen, dining, living room, and patio. Hence, it feels just like a 2b1b since you get your own wing. \n\nIt's located right in the heart of campus, next to the Lawson CS Building and Bechtel Design Center. It's <5-15 min walk to almost all the buildings in all directions. Basically, it's even closer to the academic buildings than the residence halls are. It comes with free parking, which is extremely convenient due to its close proximity to buildings. It's also independent/privately owned (so no leasing company antics), and the owner is super accommodating and flexible.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you are interested :)",

Obviously the atomic bombings were bad, but on the scale of victims not only were there less victims than the atrocities Japan committed in Nanking or against Korea but most of them died nearly instantly while victims of the rape of Nanking or comfort women died over the course of months or years. It just seems like revisionism meant to erase the guilt of the perpetrators of the war and somehow claim to have been victimized. I don\u2019t believe people commonly make the argument about the Nazi Germans who got firebombed in Dresden despite the fact many were innocent civilians too.\n\nThe book I was referencing wasn\u2019t even about the atomic bombings. One of them was about how unfortunate it was Japanese people traveling abroad couldn\u2019t return home after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, which I mean yeah isn\u2019t great but like on the order of human suffering at the time especially the human suffering caused by Japan feels odd and maybe even malicious to focus on, like the south not focusing on slavery but focusing on the sack of Jacksonville, it\u2019s bad but revisionist to claim the civil war is \u201cthe war of northern aggression\u201d just because of some suffering that occurred due to a conflict you started. It\u2019s unfortunate for the innocent civilians who were stuck overseas but at the same time I feel like it degrades the victims of the literal largest scale examples of systemic sexual violence and pedophilia in human history on one hand, or the victims of the largest slaughter of civilians in human history, etc that happened due to Japan\u2019s violence in Asia. Honestly I feel the individual victims are indeed victims, just like in any war, but Japan as a country is not the victim of World War Two and honestly it\u2019s scary that this revisionist narrative is being pushed.\n\nI\u2019d make the same argument about Germany too honestly, except that when there are German revisionists they are rightfully shot down. We just don\u2019t see that happen with Japanese revisionists claiming victimhood.\n\n> When the soldiers came back from the battlefields, as many as 20 men would come to my room from early morning. That's why I had to have a hysterectomy (in my twenties). They rounded up little girls still in school. Their genitals were still underdeveloped, so they became torn and infected. There was no medicine except something to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and Mercurochrome. They got sick, their sores became septic, but there was no treatment. The soldiers made Chinese laborers lay straw in the trenches and the girls were put in there. There was no bedding... underneath was earth. There was no electricity at that time, only oil lamps, but they weren't even given a lamp. They cried in the dark \"Mummy, it hurts! Mummy, I'm hungry!\" We wanted to go and give them our leftover food, but there were a lot of sick and disturbed people in the trenches. Some of them had TB. I was scared they might pull me in to the trenches, and I didn't want to go there. I could have gone if I had a lamp. When someone died the girls got scared and began to cry. Then everyone in the trenches was poisoned and they closed up the trench. They dug another trench next to it.\n\nhttps://www.awf.or.jp/e3/oralhistory-00.html",

How is it possible to select the most useful, insightful, important problems and concepts for an undergraduate class, especially given that Purdue doesn't generally get the top of the top in terms of engineering candidates (MIT, Stanford, etc.), and you can't treat all the students as if they have a tremendously good baseline in advanced mathematics?\n\nSo many of the tests I took in aero eng came down not to how well you knew the material but whether or not you'd come across the specific trick they stuck in the exam question during your study (like integrals that are near impossible to solve by hand in under 20 minutes, but had a substitution that allowed solving in 15 seconds). This gave a decent signal for grades, as students who didn't work hard (who were already weak students) wouldn't have seen the tricks, and students that did work hard (who were already strong students) usually had seen the trick, but it wasn't a perfect signal. I felt that multiple times I was awarded a low grade that didn't match my understanding of the material, but it cut both ways--I also often managed to score highly on an exam without having a fundamental understanding of what or why I was solving.\n\nIf I were free to design an engineering curriculum, I think I would try to build in exams that were really, really long and verbose, possibly taking up to 4-6 hours to complete, but contained a lot of easier surface-level questions about the material (e.g. \"why is this formula considered invalid when flow is compressible?\" or \"what are the units of alpha in this equation, given both in SI and imperial?\") that encouraged some rote memorization as well as a lot of more trivial reasoning questions to ensure competency in each area of the curriculum material, and then for the final two hours of the test I'd throw in the more conventional long-form problems. But of course, that would dramatically increase testing and grading overhead costs and time... but it would result in better student mastery of the material... I don't know, I'd do a lot of things differently if I had that power to reform education.",

Students are absolutely capable of understanding this content, it just takes an immense amount of time and effort that students aren't motivated to do if they find a shortcut.\n\nThat's not to say that the methods of teaching and testing are lacking, and I certainly agree that some changes would greatly improve the quality of learning at Purdue, but the students and faculty generally aren't interested in doing so unless it affects the bottom line of getting an education here, which is the median first year salary and hiring rate of Purdue graduates. From my own experience, I've had some former students (masters/phd) who taught me math and physics far better than any professor. I think Purdue ought to have those students teach the courses over some professor who is more qualified but worse at explaining.\n\n Students would also be far more motivated to study and get a good job if they weren't so demoralized by the things they hear from alumni (long hours, being underpaid, high stress, etc.) but that's more an issue with the economy/workforce and not something universities control.",

    "title": "The Purdue Indy Lie",
    "body": "I'll explain why I posted this here, let me get directly to the point first:\n\nAs a former student at Indy, Purdue blatantly lies in order to make the campus seem comparable to WL. While many lies are fairly obvious to WL students, it is less so to others, considering how the little information Purdue provides about Indy is mostly false. Some short examples are listed below.\n\n(Note: When I say \"Purdue\", I am referring to Purdue WL. The majority of administration is done by WL staff.)\n\n**Misrepresenting Academic Achievements/Opportunities**\n\nOne of the few pieces of Indy related information still available on Purdue's website is the[ Indy Year One report](https://www.purdue.edu/campuses/indianapolis/indy-year-one/). The report brags about high rankings - #1 actuarial program in the US? That must be a good school!\n\nOne problem - Indy did not even offer the actuarial science problem in the first year. In fact, all school rankings in the report are for WL.\n\nAnother example is how the report claims that \"Purdue is Indianapolis\u2019 designated R1 research institution\". In reality, it is [IU-Indy that has R1 status](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/iu-indianapolis-joins-list-of-187-institutions-nationwide-with-top-research-status). Misrepresenting rankings like this is a consistent pattern almost every time Purdue talks about Indy, whether via a recruiter presentation or press release. (wasn't able to find a zoom recruiter presentation).\n\nPurdue WL academic achievements/opportunities are not applicable to Indy, period. One has 1,700+ grad students in the college of science, the other has 2. There are ZERO undergrad CS research opportunities at Indy.\n\nDon't even get me started on the whole debacle regarding the ME-motorsports dual degree [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1ni2zia/motorsports_and_mechanical_engineering_at_purdue/).....\n\n**Admission Standards at Indy**\n\nPurdue has constantly claimed that the Indy and WL campus have the same admission standards. Admins have even repeated this talking point in public [media](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/education/what-to-know-purdue-university-in-indianapolis-iupui-iu-college-education-boilermakers/531-e527ba8f-032b-4acb-9eb7-d43027823cab).\n\nWe can easily disprove this via the [Data Digest](https://www.purdue.edu/datadigest/), which shows an OOS CS admit rate of 79.2%. For context, the CS admit rate for all students at WL in fall 2023 was <30%. Note that the media interview was done a month after RD decisions.\n\n**Misc. lies**\n\nListing all of Purdue's false claims would turn this post into a 20 minute video essay. Here are a couple short examples just to get a taste of what the experience is really like.\n\nPurdue claims that Indy has the same academic opportunities as WL. Class availability is severely restricted - there are no CS 300 level classes. The sustainability of adding more classes is questionable given most people are already off track of their degree progression - there are a total of FOUR people in CS 242 for fall 2025 according to UniTime. (CS 242 is required for DS majors - it is taken in the first semester of 2nd year).\n\nPurdue's promotional media often shows clubs that don't exist in Indy. The photos are almost always photos of Indy unrelated to the actual campus. This is because you could walk past Purdue Indy and not realize it - the majority of the campus is for IUI, and even then most buildings are shared with IUI and still have IU branding.\n\nPurdue released a promotional video showcasing a Indy student. The student claims that he is majoring in CS and with a minor in statistics. It is not possible to add a statistics minor at Purdue Indy given how it is not offered there. In reality, he is a former IUPUI student - god knows how Purdue handles that.\n\nPurdue claims that peer tutoring services are only offered at Indy. This is completely false.\n\nLong story short, I would say that the majority of information by Purdue regarding the Indy campus is misleading or inaccurate. If you have more examples, please put them in the comments.\n\n**Why yap now?**\n\nI posted this for the sake of the smart students I met still there - they deserve better, and many are going to extreme lengths to overcome their lack of resources. Lots are spending hours on buses, some sleep in public areas in WL, and a couple even bought apartments so they could live near the WL campus; all just to be able to take classes they need or participate in student life. While Purdue talks about \"Two locations, One Purdue\", I am sleeping on the WALC couch so I can do a night exam for a class that isn't offered in Indy. Many WL Professors have also been making a serious effort to improve the campus, commuting 15+ hours weekly to ensure that WL are Indy classes are the same.\n\nIt's been a month since I transferred, and since then it is painful to realize how deficient Purdue Indy is in even the basics. My personal theory is there is only one reason why Purdue goes to such lies to portray Indy as part of the main campus - had people known the truth about Indy, it would be completely undesirable.\n\nBlatant lies can only fool for so long when people are living in them - nearly 22% of people left Purdue Indy engineering in the first year, either to a different school or to the main campus (You can switch if you drop your current major at Indy and your new major isn't at Indy). The same figure is 8% at WL. (Source: Data Digest)\n\nI don\u2019t blame Purdue for every problem Indy faces \u2014 building a new campus is difficult. What\u2019s not difficult is to be at least somewhat truthful.  You can just search indy in this subreddit to see how students think about it. Until Purdue decides to address its problems honestly, the amount of out of state and international students (which are the majority of students) will go close to 0.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope this creates productive discussion into what the Indy campus really is. If you have questions I encourage you to ask in a comment.\n\nUpdate 1: Thank you for the large amount of support. I would like to answer some commonly asked questions:\n\n**Q: What was your major?**  CS. I am aware that some problems differ with Eng. majors, but I don't have personal perspective into that.\n\n**Q: Why didn't you cover \\[x\\] issue?** I wanted to focus on the repeated pattern of outright lying. There was going to be issues no matter what given it was the first year - mistakes happen.\n\nHowever, deliberately misrepresenting/lying about the campus is absolutely in bad faith and is far more than just mistakes. Worse, there is nearly no accurate information about Indy from official sources - try looking at Purdue's Indy website. Students are suffering because of Purdue's lies right now, and I want to prioritize refuting these lies.\n\n**Q: How did you get \\[x\\] from the data?** A couple of notes on the data:\n\n1. Indy data is listed under \"Indy and W Lafayette\".\n2. I was able to get the CS department admit rates for Indy since in Fall 2024, the college of science contained only the CS department.\n3. The freshman profile page merges WL and Indy data, inflating the percentages by several percent. This is also why I used the fall 2023 profile to get CS admit rates for WL only.\n\nLastly, I want to post some messages sent in DM's by Indy students with their permission. They speak for themselves.\n\n>\"I have to sacrifice my entire MWF for one class in WL, and I have to miss out on lunch. I can \\[have lunch at WL\\] but I have to buy it, because there are no meal swipes or meal plan. And lunch is expensive, so it\u2019s not really lunch, just a small snack\u2026 mainly because I eat breakfast before coming then eat dinner at 6:00 PM. I\u2019m probably going to rent an apartment near WL so that I can go to main campus\"\n\n>\"i asked about a math double major and my advisor told me to spend 15 hours on a bus weekly because there arent courses here to complete it. i also have to take a cs course in the middle of the day :D\"\n\n>\"Many classes here are now taught by grad students or IU professors. atp im not sure what is the same or not \\[compared to WL\\]\"\n\n>\"purdue college of science promised a guaranteed professional practice opportunity exclusive to indy students, i spent the freshman year asking constantly for details about this and nobody knew anything. try finding information about this online... good luck lol\"\n\nYou get the point, this wasn't even all of them. If you are a Indy student, I encourage you to find ways to take action yourself. Don't wait for the administration to solve problems, it won't happen.",

So I did a little digging and I found that there is an option on the data digest to select both \"PUI and WL\" Campus, which in turn shows what is a number very similar to the incoming class at PUI (unless there are only 5000 engineering applicants to all of WL). Did some math and I found the WL Engineering  has an acceptance rate of 31%, while these stats show what I believe to be PUI having a 53%. (Although I would like to add that the yield rate is actually lower, so in the end there is the same percentage of applications to actually coming there).

The reality is is that the only difference is that at PUI you have to take a bus ride. All the same opportunities are the same. While I agree the bus ride is annoying I often have hours of homework most nights and the busses have free internet so I don't really think it as any different. Other than that all right. Purdue is very much sugar coating what its like. It is very much sad that people wanting a dual motorsports business degree did not get what they wanted, especially because since motorsports is not at main campus, you can't get it anywhere else (atleast from Purdue).\n\nAdmission Standards: Here's the reality. Looking at the data digest, this year admit rate at Purdue WL went down. like by 10% from last year and 5% from the year before. If you add up the total class acceptance rates from both PUI and WL, you get about that same average. (At least for engineering, as if you look at totals PUI follows similar patterns, although this year there was a much lower on average acceptance rate overall and the difference was larger). Take that as you will. I would like to add that I feel like there must be something between you and me that I don't know because there are much better data to prove your point (like the one I said before) and choosing that specifically misrepresents your point in a manipulative way (basically doing the same thing Purdue is doing with their data).\n\nMISC: Not in comp sci, but PUI comp sci you spend two years in PUI and two years in WL, so it makes since that third year courses aren't available. Clubs certainly exists, not as many, but you appear to have only been there the first year and because of that the school started when most of the clubs weren't founded, there is now music club, robotics club, women in engineering, motorsports, and more. Not nearly the same experience as the many many many that are offered at WL, but still that could be because there is a LOT more people at WL then here. Also, you can get a minor in statistics, IF you take classes at WL, which you are required to take the bus for. So while all of his major is at PUI, he is basically getting his minor at WL.\n\nI would appreciate somebody else to look at my statements and give me a little more info, because even though I did do a lot of looking, I still would appreciate somebody else to give me the same treatment in search of more info",

It just will suck if you\u2019re not invested with trying to start new things and participate in more clubs.\n\nI\u2019m a former PUI ME who recently switched Aero to be closer to my research opportunities in Zucrow, but I can honestly say that my participation/life hasn\u2019t changed much too. The difference is that logistics are a lot easier, but instead of commuting an 1:15 of to Zucrow/WL it takes 15-20 to walk or hike everywhere. My classes were the same as WL students, and I\u2019d study with friends from WL too.\n\nPUI defrauds you on clubs/minors/CS research opps (there\u2019s a few good ones for MSE and even some ME) because everything is new and not in place, but if you\u2019re just getting your degree, then you\u2019re fine.\n\nEdit: not saying PUI doesn\u2019t fuck over professors because professors still have to commute back in forth, but per info from Carl Wassgren, but some profs are looking to move labs to Indy to be closer to family.",

        "body": "Computer Science (CS) and First-Year Engineering (FYE) are completely different areas of study, with distinct classes and approaches although some overlap might exist. Imagine standing at a crossroads in your academic journey: one path focused on lines code and virtual worlds, the other with hands-on projects and real-world inventions. Which one calls to you? \nStart by taking a quick look at the FYE curriculum and comparing it to your current and upcoming CS classes this semester and next. You might find a few overlaps that could ease the transition. Plus, if you have AP credits, some classes could be waived entirely. Don\u2019t  overlook that!\nNext, take a hard look at the future courses in CS. Do they excite you? Engineering offers a fresh perspective: it\u2019s more hands-on, requiring you to think outside the box and tackle problems in tangible ways. I\u2019m not saying CS lacks creativity or innovation- it absolutely doesn\u2019t but in CS, your toolkit is primarily software-based, involving heavy coding and application use. You can often access these tools online and work independently from anywhere.\nIn contrast, engineering demands a mix of independent work and frequent collaboration with teams, often in labs or group projects. (Full disclosure: I\u2019m jotting this down off the top of my head, so it\u2019s not perfectly defined.)\nIf engineering sparks your interest, you\u2019ll need to pinpoint which specific branch appeals to you - mechanical, electrical, civil, or something else? Each has a very tailored path, so do some self-reflection on what you truly want to pursue. We all get it: no one knows for sure at your stage. But try making a long list of pros and cons for each major. Why choose one over the other? Study the course descriptions in detail, and chat with upperclassmen or professionals in those fields for real insights.\nAs others have mentioned, switching majors at the end of your freshman year could delay graduation, so factor that in. I hope this gives you some solid ideas to explore your options and find the path that feels right.",

    "body": "**TLDR:** have yall been noticing an uptick in people \u201charassing\u201d you n shit? (**for lack of better words**, its not THAT serious)\n\nalso, i\u2019m tired and wanna be petty. how can i effectively report public \u201charassment\u201d (for lack of better words) incidents directly to purdue/is there anything i can do? I would really like to hold these guys accountable, if possible.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nthrowaway account ig cuz ive never used reddit before. i feel silly directly complaining to reddit after this shit but ion know anywhere else better to complain/ask questions to.\n\nshort story even shorter, at around 10:50 PM Today (Friday, Sept. 26th), i was biking home from work when i got egged by some kid in the back of a black pickup truck. i was on the crosswalk by the University church, about to reach the Union Hotel on N Grant St. They then sped off down the road and took a left on Mitch Daniels Blvd. towards Harry's Chocolate shop. idk shit about cars but it was a black or dark blue pickup truck, newer model, probably somewhere between 2018 to current year. did not get the make or license plate cuz the kid drove off but i saw 4 (maybe 5?) guys in it, all college age, all white males. Kid who threw the egg had red curly hair (i think?), or at least something red on his head at the time. I don't really remember.\n\nNow look, I'm 22 years old. I been dealt with shit like this before. I been beat up, made fun of, iss nothin new or crazy. it's not like I'm \"so unbearably upset\" that I got hit by one egg. I'm showered up. I washed my clothes and my bike. I could forget about this tomorrow, it\u2019s over and done. but in regard to being on CAMPUS getting my COLLEGE EDUCATION and being a working ADULT, this is something that is relatively new to me and is happening more and more, and this shit keeps continuing to happen. It feels like the more I shrug my shoulders to this shit, the more it occurs, and it's to the point where somebody jus gotta be held accountable for the stupid shit they pullin man.\n\nFor example: Couple months ago i got called the F slur by some guys on the street while i was literally just walking home cuz my hair was in a ponytail. Just a few weeks ago some other guys rolled up beside me while i was driving home from walmart and was deadass pestering me and making fun of my appearance cuz I was playing music (at a respectable volume), i guess? And now I'm gettin eggs thrown at me? for ion even know what?? lmao??? and iss all different cases of guys in cars rollin up to me and bein a dick for like 30 seconds and then speeding off because they're in a car and can get away with it. all while I'm jus minding my own business. and they don't even let me say some shit back or come up to me and hash it out!!! lol :/ like I know this sounds like cope but genuinely its pathetic. how do you do this shit and not immediately feel embarassed.\n\nAnd like on one hand, I get it. I know these guys are just having fun on a weekend just getting up to a little mischief to look tough and cool... but on the other hand... College is a privilege, and if you're gonna spend your free time here bein a jackass and a nuisance to the other students, yo ass shouldn't be here, plain and simple. I don't care if I sound like a dork for that. get a fuckin hobby or sumn lol.\n\nSo I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do about this? Is there a way I can report this to Purdue? Could they check all the camera footage on N Grant St./Mitch Daniels Blvd. around 10:40 - 10:55 and find the truck/ID these guys? Would they even care? Is it even worth pursuing? I don't know. First thing I did was go into the Union Hotel and ask them to check their cameras. They asked for my name and number and said they'd get back to me but I'm not sure what all they'd do, if anything at all tbh. I would report it to the cops but its a bit late now and honestly they prolly aint gonna waste their time tracking down dudes throwing eggs around just to tell them to fuck off anyways.\n\nBut I guess, if nothing else, I was also wondering if this has been happening to others? because I need to stress, as far as I appear publicly, I do not stick out of the crowd at ALL and I do my best to not bother people. and before anyone says it: IM A GOOD BIKER lol i don't be riding in front of cars and swerving around walkers at mach speed n shit. and i was on the sidewalk the whole time anyway so there's no reason for a car to even be pissed at me.\n\nI guess I'm just curious cuz it's lwk gettin to my head. Again, it don't really bother me that much, but like, am i missin' something?? I can't be the only one experiencing this shit, no?? do I really look THAT unlikeable to where I'm always the one getting picked outta the crowd to fuck wit?? lmaooo\n\nnah but fr iss crazy. If I could I'd love to get these mfs expelled. I'm not even the petty type usually, I genuinely am just tired of seein mfs getting away with this shit with zero accountability. I do not believe Purdue should be a place for hatred, discrimination, and public mischief. Even if that can't happen though, i would at LEAST like to file some sort of report to feel like I did SOMETHING to help stop this bullshit, and I don't really know what the best way to go about that is.\n\nAnd again. I aint crying about this shit, i been good. but sumn about physical \"harassment\" (again, for lack of better words) jus crosses a line for me in terms of the integrity of this school, and I really do not think it's a good idea to let that slide. You can't be doin all that unchecked.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nNOTE: **do not doxx them** if you know them, pretty sure I'm not allowed to ask for people's info to be publicized and I need to be clear that's not what I want. BUT if you know anything or got egged tonight yourself and are willing to share times, dates, locations and other general info of where it took place so that I can get more evidence of these guys doin this shit, please feel free to share or reach out to me in private. Idk if DM's exist on reddit but yeah. idk. thanks.\n\nand don't be doin this shit man. i promise you getting drunk with your friends is more fun than throwing eggs at people going home from a long day of classes and work. thanks.\n\nQuick Edit for context: I been here for 3 years (going on a fourth) and I've never had any incidents before 2025. It's like sumn shifted the moment this year started ong\n\nAnother edit: I contacted the Purdue PD and they were already aware of the vehicle (others had reported them too, I guess they been at it). They couldn't track them down last night so I guess that's really all I can do unless I hear back from the Union Hotel (unlikely), but I appreciate the help.",

I obviously don't know exactly what you did, but \"reviewing\" the past exam questions could be looking over them or actually solving them. I also briefly looked at the practice run exam, and I think that it only covered the first half of the class up until the date of the practice run. Also, the recitation and lab aren't really correlated at all currently. There were some questions from the recitation, but most came from lecture material. \n\nWhat I did was a brief look over various concepts to see what I don't know very well or did poorly on.  If I did poorly on that homework or didn't know how to do it, I learned how to do it (chatGPT and other AI's are great at helping to teach concepts and explain where you are going wrong, just obviously don't use it directly on homework problems or anything else), and then practiced on boiler exams. This was especially helpful for the light emission and energy questions. Practice until you feel confident, and then move onto the next concept if needed. You don't need to be perfect, but you should hopefully start to feel more confident and get a better grasp of the ideas. \n\nThe most important thing is that you put in the work to improve, not only in course material, but in your studying habits and other school skills like note taking as well.

    "body": "TL;DR: I scrubbed my place top to bottom, documented everything, and still got hit with \u201cautomatic\u201d carpet cleaning and a bogus $90 \u201clabor\u201d fee to replace 3 light bulbs (my lease says $4 per bulb). When I asked for an itemized list, they said they \u201cdon\u2019t do those.\u201d Don\u2019t waste your weekend deep-cleaning expecting a full refund, protect yourself with documentation and be ready to challenge deductions.\n\nFor context, I rented with BK management last year a 50+ yr unit. I moved in to a livable unit, just not a perfect one (bath tub, ceiling, etc) but since I will be here for a year and alone I didnt mind it. I stayed there for a year with no furniture and only a mattress and spent most of my times in the lab. I am a very organized and responsible person so I made sure the apartment always stays at the same move in condition.\n\nMove out day comes, spend hours cleaning and making sure everything is in perfect notches before I turn in my unit, which I did so that I can get back my deposit knowing full well these turds will still find ways to take some of it. Note that I took pictures during move in and opened a maintenance request with all the findings WHICH EVERYONE SHOULD DO.\n\n40 days later, I get an email for a refund of $39 (deposit was $800). Cleaning, cleaning carpet, hair cut for the guy cleaning the carpet, paint and a bunch of other bullshits. I emailed them stating that I do not accept this and they should refund the full amount because these are not true, which I have used clear indiana laws clauses that states landlords should not take the deposit unless it is for unpaid bill/lease or damage beyond repair, which they right away agreed to refund me the paint and a credit of $50 just to shut me off. They stated that carpet cleaning is in the contract, which I did accept, but cleaning, paint, and the absurd cost of replacing 3 light bulbs ( although i replaced all defected light bulbs) were not part of the contract yet it was not respected.\n\nSo the message is: no matter how spotless you leave it, some places will still deduct. Don\u2019t let the promise of a \u201cclean equals deposit back\u201d myth steal your time.\n\nLesson learned:\n- always take photos before and after and communicate it to your landlord.\n- Dont spend time worrying about turning a clean apartment to these scums \n- you can appeal this in tippecanoe county court by filing a small claim which you do not need a lawyer or anything just evidence. It costs approximately $150 which you can get back if you win.\n\n\nInfo: they tried to use the below pic to blame me for damages to the property. Those people are not honorable and will not respect anything you say or appeal. ",

    "body": "**Purdue University leads in innovation. Why can\u2019t it do the same in health equity?**\u00a0In 2025, Purdue aligned its prescription benefits coverage with AffirmedRx, rolling out a new formulary that reclassified nearly 700 prescription drugs and medical devices from preventative to non-preventative status. While some may still be covered after deductibles are met, this shift has drastically increased out-of-pocket costs and created serious barriers to care. Even staff members paying for the highest premium plans are now facing exorbitant out-of-pocket costs for medications and supplies that should be affordable. Purdue HR has claimed this formulary increases accessibility, but our lived reality shows the opposite. Instead of removing barriers, this change has put health and financial strain on the very people who keep Purdue running. When staff are forced to worry about whether or not we can afford our essential prescriptions, we cannot serve our students or Purdue\u2019s mission at our best.\n\n**We call on Purdue HR and the Board of Trustees to reevaluate this formulary and its decision to align with AffirmedRx**\u00a0so that every member of the Purdue community has access to affordable, equitable healthcare coverage.\n\n**Our health is not negotiable.

If all else fails, don't hesitate to go to a study group session or visit your prof during office hours with some review questions in hand.\n\nAlso just a tip for the later half of 272 but right hand rule is like a magic wand that turns questions into answers (slight exaggeration but if you're absolutely lost, try using it).",

As far as having answers checked before an exam submission, \n\n* She's not giving the right answer, just making sure people don't give up or anything.\n* ECE is a nortoriously hard field to understand. The students who do finish their tests earlier are most likely to be the students who recognize how hard ECE is and probably studied their ass off for said test. \n* Regarding pointing out errors for students who finished early, I'd much rather have a teacher point out some dumb math error I made rather even though I completely understand the theory rather than unnecessarily lose points and fail the course (which was the case before Al-Othman). And even if you didn't finish on time, you have plenty more opportunities later on in the course to show that you understand the material and recuperate points.\n\nBasically, have some couth and understand that she's doing her best to help you succeed and not lose passion for the field. She takes pride in teaching her students and you should be grateful that there's someone who actually will recognize your effort and point you in the right direction. This isn't high school, you have to make an effort and learn the material instead of being an asshole cuz youre used to 'no child left behind'.

They have switched to Nutanix this semester due to some issues with VMWare, but they function around the same. The infrastructure can be accessed from any old browser on any computer. \n\nThough it might be a good idea to look at requirements for running personal VMs on the laptop. Think running a virtualized instance of Kali Linux or Windows 11 on the laptop itself. That would likely be an x64 processor, around a Ryzen 5 or i5. With around 1TB of storage, and 8-16 GB of RAM for optimal use. Don't bother with the \"gaming\" laptops with dedicated GPUs, they add more expense and bulk for little gain. Having a built in Ethernet cable would also be handy as well.\n\nTL;DR: The only \"hard requirement\" is to have a laptop that can run Firefox and the Nutanix web UI, which literally anything can. But I'd recommend a Ryzen 5 or i5 or above, 1TB SSD, with around 8-16 GB of RAM and an Ethernet Adapter built in (optional). \n\nPersonally, I rock a Thinkpad T14 Gen 5, but tbh any laptop in those specs will work great.",

Most Macbooks are very expensive, costing hundreds, if not thousands more than their Windows counterparts for minimal gain for cybersecurity tasks, and causing compatibility issues. \n\nThere's also compatibility issues. In the cybersecurity world, most tools are made for Linux, containerization (Docker), and Windows, with Mac usually being the last OS for consideration. \n\nThe final point i would like to make is customization. Macs tend to be a lot more \"locked down\" than a Windows PC. Like there's more of a struggle to change or modify things, both hardware and software wise. This works fine for most people, but for IT and Cybersecurity, it becomes a headache. \n\nIt's not that you can't get a Mac under no circumstances, I know plenty of Cybersecurity majors who do so.

This means that your official Purdue transcript will list MA 15300 and MA 1XMQR as your two math courses (with MA 15800 noticeably missing). \n\nHowever, MATH 136 at Ivy Tech and MA 15300 at Purdue are considered equivalent. Thus, any reasonable person would conclude that if MATH 136 + MATH 137 at Ivy Tech gives you credit for MA 15800 and some extra elective credits, then a student who takes MA 15300 at Purdue and MATH 137 at Ivy Tech should also have credit for MA 15800. The thing is, the coding system doesn't recognize that. As such, if you want to take MA 16010 at Purdue (which has an MA 15800 prerequisite), you'll likely need to request an override or email someone to explain why it's okay for you to take MA 16010.\n\nIn your case though, I don't see why you wouldn't just take both MATH 137 and MATH 201 at Ivy Tech, since you said you'd like to avoid more math at Purdue. You can take MATH 137 in the spring at Ivy Tech while taking 12 credits at Purdue at the same time. Then you can knock out MATH 201 at Ivy Tech over the summer.",

It MIGHT be possible if there's an early pre-calc module that you take in the beginning of summer, and a later applied calc module in the second half of the summer, but I don't know if Ivy Tech's modules are staggered in such a way.\n\nRegarding \"timing out\" in EXPL: Remember that while you have four semesters in EXPL, only fall and spring semesters count, not summers. Thus, if you're currently in your first semester, you still basically have 2 years.\n\nIn the event that you are nearing the limit of your time in EXPL, there are a couple options. Which option to take really depends on your specific circumstances. If you KNOW you want to CODO to a CIT major, but you aren't quite eligible to CODO yet, your advisor would submit your CODO to CIT and you'll need to wait until after your grades post to see if you get in. However, if you're out of time in EXPL, you won't be able to register for classes until after you CODO - which means you'd be registering for classes during open registration right before the semester starts.\n\nHowever, if you KNOW you want to CODO to CIT, but you know it won't be possible to meet CODO requirements after your last semester in EXPL, you can CODO to the Waypoints program, which is a small program housed within the broader undergraduate advising office. Waypoints is a program for students who cannot continue in their current major, know where they want to CODO to, and just need another semester or two to raise their GPA to get to their desired major.\n\nCIT majors (i.e., any major housed within the Department of Computer and Information Technology) have becoming increasingly competitive. If you're looking into parallel plans like Finance, I'd also look toward something like [Business Analytics and Information Management](https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=32831&returnto=24160), as this major combines business with a heavy computing component. Additionally, if you're looking for something more hands-on and technical, you might consider [Computer Engineering Technology](https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&poid=33872&returnto=23644).

They are currently attempting to negotiate a deal with the university, and leadership believed that a continued pro-international stance in the shadow of ongoing cuts and federal government pressure would endanger that deal with Purdue.\n\nLast school year, the then-editor and leadership announced the Exponent would no longer be publishing the names of international students who were facing deportation over campus protesting. They rightly said it was meant to protect students on campus whos names appeared in their paper. This semester, the new leadership quietly but firmly abandoned that position. The Exponent will begin outing the names of pro-Palestine and international protesters again.\n\nThen, the organization refused to stop accepting advertisements from ICE, even after posts online called them out for it. They claim rejecting the ads would hurt them financially.\n\nAnd then, after pressure from Purdue, they fired every international student in the organization a few weeks ago. That's a third of their entire staff. No real reason was ever given other than they had to do it because Purdue told them to. Instead of standing up for its students, the Exponent acquiesced, scared of endangering its ongoing deal.\n\nThe Exponent has completely bent over for the university, just like most media organizations in the country are. This needs to stop. I loved the Exponent for everything it gave me, but it's not the organization it was two or even one year ago.",

For years, international students have been an integral part of the Exponent and we are working diligently to figure out a way to bring them back. However, currently, it would be illegal for us to employ international students and it would risk their legal status in the United States. Our response has been an effort to protect them from an unintended consequence that we don\u2019t want to see.\n\nIt saddens our organization, and me personally, to turn away our four current international students, plus those who were attempting to join following our callout.

Multiple agreed and said that it did indeed hurt. \n\nSo, I submitted a fix it. I got a reply the next day stating that the issue had been investigated and was considered solved. \n\nIt was not. \n\nI tried to just tough it out. I counted the intervals in between when the hot water would come in an attempt to predict it, but it was completely random. It would range from three to twelve seconds apart, but each time the water was blazing hot. I tried only turning the cold water on, and it would still come out hot every few seconds. \n\nI feel like lately it's gotten worse, and it's hard for me to not gasp or yelp in pain when it happens.

I decided to give it a shot this semester and had 2 interviews and eventually landed a position through IR at a large defense company. Think of the event as a large social event, and don\u2019t get intimidated by the other students around you that seem to know/have a lot more experience than you (I\u2019ve met plenty of people at IR that had cracked resumes and ik its hard but try your best to). I liked to think of it as a really nice way to meet peers in engineering, you know something as simple as asking the person behind you in line how their experience at the fair has been so far and whats up. That really helped me be less intimidated by the hundreds of other students fighting for the same positions and become a little more laid back and chill when talking to recruiters. In terms of what you say, you first walk up to them and smile and shake their hand. Then you hand them your resume and ask them how they are and maybe something else like How has this recruiting season been so far (remember they\u2019re still humans at the end of the day and have to filter through hundreds of resumes and its nice to be spoken to like a normal human being - I\u2019d say do this if they seem nice and interested, most at career fairs are). Then introduce yourself, background, and pitch a few relevant experiences and some of the roles you seek. Then continue to talk to them, ask them about the intern program, some current projects the company works on and maybe how intern to full time conversion works since you are a junior. It does seem a little intimidating going in, but once you start talking to your peers and companies the process honestly becomes pretty chill, the waiting in line really is the worst part",

I\u2019m thinking of taking the Finance CODO prerequisites next semester so I can fall back to Finance if CIT doesn\u2019t work out.\n\nBut the stigma of it all kinda worries me, but also if I\u2019m boxing myself in and limiting my potential. We\u2019ve obviously heard the stereotype of business majors not being hard, and I don\u2019t know if that applies to Purdue and how, but I\u2019m mainly worried about if my career opportunities/success in finance will be more limited than CIT careers, like in pay, job scarcity/competition, AI replacement, etc. I\u2019m mainly worried about the future more than anything and if going from CIT to Finance might be a regrettable choice if it doesn\u2019t do we\u2019ll post grad.\n\nThoughts? (Also any advice on how I can pass this damn College Algebra class? I know it sounds dumb that I\u2019m struggling, but the professor even told us that the average score on the first exam ACROSS ALL CLASSES was a 50% (F) so something bad is happening)",

It is not. You are expected to have basic knowledge of differential equations, at *minimum* vector calculus for all the coordinate system transformations. Thermodynamics basics are needed, general relativity is also needed but I think the percent that needs general relativity will amp up later in the semester.\n\n  \nNo exams, 1 final that's 30% of your grade, homework is 50% of the grade. Participation is the other 20%. \n\nHomework is mostly manipulating equations you learned in class, but there's a lot of plotting you need to do. Highly recommend learning python/matlab, but a classmate is currently using desmos. If you're not comfortable with staring at an equation for an hour and trying to think about how to get to a different one, probably gonna be a struggle.\n\n  \nLectures are fairly chill, does a lot of derivations in class, but if you miss a lecture you *are* fucked, no notes are posted, but you can ask the prof for his notes for prior ones after/before class. Also, textbook is quite helpful if you do miss one, not as easy to follow but that's always the case.",

And ngl, college for me has been spent mostly getting rejected by friends and potential partners. \n\nI would recommend, if you\u2019re feeling lonely or want someone to actively try, tell your friends that. That you need more effort on their end. Good relationships ( friends, bf/gf, family, etc) don\u2019t come from bottling up this loneliness. It comes from being honest about how you feel \u2014- esp when you need someone. I cannot count how many times I\u2019ve been let down people because the didn\u2019t know I was struggling or just needed to talk to someone. There were nights I was struggling with depression by myself with no one to call so I get it\u2019s hard to express these feelings; but your wants and needs (to be seen, feel loved) are more than valid and will always be more than valid. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard, but it takes one conversation to express your needs.

That\u2019s not as easy to spot, but some spam emailers will pick an email or phone number that seems like it\u2019s from a trusted sender with one or two letters or digits changed. \n\nThe \u201cshipping fee\u201d in this one is suspicious as well. Anything that asks you for money before you can see the product is a red flag. \n\n\u201cAct quickly\u201d is a very common trick used by scammers; it gets you to contact them to secure their offer before you have time to think about whether it\u2019s actually legit. It\u2019s better to pass it up because you decided to think on it for a couple minutes versus losing hundreds of dollars over something you\u2019ll never receive. \n\nAnd NEVER click a link in an email unless you know the person who sent it to you very well (for example if the email came from your professor and you\u2019ve verified it\u2019s from the correct email in your syllabus). Even if it\u2019s a full-on link spelled out, scammers can use the text from one link and then hyperlink it for another site entirely. \n\nIn general, don\u2019t give anyone personal information unless you know exactly where it\u2019s going.\n\nAny tips I missed? \n\nEdit for minor wording",

I have a roommate who I thought was fine but after a month into classes, he\u2019s presenting himself as more and more of an issue. \n\nI generally am pretty flexible with whatever concerns or comments someone might have, especially someone who I am having to live with. My roommate, however, is not. The way he acts is more of \u201cthis is my room that you\u2019re just in\u201d as opposed to \u201cthis is a shared living space\u201d. He expects me to bend over backward to any demands he makes or concerns. When he doesn\u2019t agree with something I\u2019m doing, he doesn\u2019t frame it as \u201chey can you do x about y because of z\u201d it\u2019s more so just \u201ccan you stop doing it.\u201d No room for compromise on his behalf. His way or no way.\n\nI\u2019ve thought of talking to him about it but the read I\u2019m getting from him makes me think that talking to him isn\u2019t going to make any to make anything better cause his stance has pretty much been \u201cdo you really need to be doing that (at the moment he finds it annoying)\u201d as if it isn\u2019t my home too\n\nI\u2019m starting to get really tired of being complained to about my own actions that really have no effect on him as well as things outside of my control such as opening the window blinds and getting home late after extracurriculars besides the fact he\u2019s annoyed that I do it. He just lacks overall etiquette and if I had to guess he never had to share a private space before.\n\nFor anyone that has had bad roommates, what can I do? I\u2019m not looking forward to the next 8 months of my life being stuck with this guy.",

However with my situation, both of us were friends before living together and we were both sophomores at the time so it was a bit more complicated. We waited far too long to address it and didn\u2019t end up being able to get new rooms until the very end of spring semester even though we wanted to move out a couple months before then. Lost a friend over it. They have specific windows for when you can switch roommates so I\u2019d say it\u2019s much better starting the discussion early if you really think it\u2019s not going to work.\n\nSometimes people just don\u2019t work as roommates, and I agree that being complained to constantly about minuscule issues gets old (same thing that happened with my roommate and she just wouldn\u2019t communicate issues with me civilly) and it is absolutely worth bringing it to attention early.

What I cannot allow is unfounded accusations that question my integrity or suggest favoritism. These comments not only harm me personally but also affect the supportive environment I work hard to create for all of you.\n\nPlease understand that if this continues, I will need to prioritize my own well-being. That may mean stepping back under Family and Medical Leave, which would change the way this course is run for the rest of the semester. That would include using only pre-recorded material and eliminating extra opportunities such as redo quizzes.\n\nI sincerely hope we do not reach that point. I am committed to your success, and I ask in return that you extend the same respect to me and to each other.\n\nThank you,\nDr. Maryam Al-Othman\u201d",

I'm currently my 5th semester in.\n\nThe main things I've got going on are Classes, Work, Extracurriculars, and Research. I work 12-16 hours a week (most of the time it's sitting around, so I'm able to do some homework or research in the meantime), I'm mechanical lead for a club that meets around 4 hours a week, with executive meetings that take 2 additional hours a week, and I'm joining a research lab that requires 10 hours a week.

I can always drop something if I need to.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you. If you read all of this, you're a real one.\n\nEdit: Added course names",

I would strongly recommend dropping the CS minor, as practical work such as leadership or research looks much better than having taken a couple extra classes. If you decide to go through with your current workload, I\u2019d like you to give me an update in a month or two just out of curiosity. Good luck out there, soldier.",

        "body": "While not these exact same courses I did take a very heavy course load with a TA position and research in my 6th semester as an ME (similar to yours sans ME 354 and the CS minor) and I would say this semester is going to be very difficult but doable with the right amount of time dedicated and you'll need to start your final projects early. To comment on every ME course you're taking:\n\nME 30801: The course is a lot of work for 1 credit, but imo it's entirely manageable if you and your group work well together. The actual labs don't take very long to complete, and if you're familiar with MATLAB processing data based on the information given in lab sheets, it shouldn't be all that difficult. The final project for this class is probably the easiest of the bunch since the scope is defined by your group, and you can make it pretty simplistic.\n\nME 315: Definitely the hardest course of the ones you're taking. Homework is weekly and tends to be very difficult. In my opinion, lectures weren't too great either, so I mostly relied on the book to figure out what I was doing. There are attendance quizzes, though, so you do have to go. Labs mostly consist of watching an object heat up and then writing about it, and compared to other lab classes, the reports do have to be rather detailed. Fortunately there are very few standard labs and the class gives you a lot of time to work on the final project, which the grading is rather strict on but again the scope is self defined and you can make it pretty easy on yourself. Exams tend to be very difficult with low averages. If you complete the practice exams, redo the homeworks and write a good crib sheet, you should be able to get around average, though.\n\nME 354: The only one of these classes was not to have a project, at least when I took it. The textbook for this class is very useful, though I also found Professor Hess' lectures to be of great help too. The course has attendance quizzes, so make sure you're there. The homework problems usually weren't bad, generally matching the difficulty of the examples done in class. Same for the exams, which you were allowed to bring crib sheets for, if you complete all of the practice material and homework assignments given, you shouldn't have that difficult of a time with this course. \n\nME 375: I'm a controls guy, so I loved this course, but if you didn't like ME 365, I can at least say this course follows a more consistent path than that one. If Lillian is the course coordinator, homework assignments are still completion based, but generally, they weren't too bad in general. By the way, make sure you get Lillian his lectures were very helpful. As opposed to 365, the hardest part of labs was actually finishing them in class where as the actual lab reports were very simple, mostly sticking to just filling out worksheets. I will warn that you need to be very careful with the final project, as parts on the robot could fry very easily without your knowledge, and you could go hours without actually realizing it happened. Once this project gets assigned, make sure you get to work on it immediately since, in my opinion, this was by and far the most consuming of the bunch. The exams generally had very straightforward free response sections with very tricky multiple choice segments, same format as 365, so nothing you haven't seen before.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any additional questions about the courses.",

We then go to nearby neighborhoods to get food to people who need it.  \n  \nSaturdays: meet at 12 PM at the Lafayette Farmers Market. We collect food for different organizations and then drop it off to them for them to distribute. Organizations include Food Finders, Home with Hope, the LTHC, Cary Home for Children and more!  \n  \nWant to be closer to campus? We're working on establishing food rescue efforts at the Purdue farmers market that happens on Thursdays on Memorial Mall. Let us know if you're interested in helping us set up that effort!  \n  \nIf you'd like to get involved you're welcome to PM me and/or just show up at the times and places listed. Look for the people with the blue IKEA bags and that's us!  \n  \nLooking forward to helping our neighbors with y'all!",

    "body": "How do you guys deal with crappy roommates? I live with an Engineering major that is a walking stereotype. At first I thought it would be fine because I don't really plan on being at the apartment but I still have to come back here to sleep. He has a big problem with cleaning up after himself (25 years old and can't wipe off a counter) and I had to get the landlord involved after he was ignoring my requests for him to clean. Landlord came down on him harder than I would've liked however I get it, we have roaches, they legally have to do something about roaches or they get in trouble. After this the roommate throws away a surprising amount of rotten food from his room and mutters \"bless his heart\" when he is sweeping up his onion skins in a hallway a couple rooms removed from the kichen. I figure that will be the end of it. It's not so hard to clean up onion skins after a month of them rotting on the floor, right? \n\nAnyways the other night he is making a mess on the counter again and I don't want to talk to him so I leave a note about putting something under your food. It was a mistake to even do the note thing but frankly he just stomps and scowls at me so I don't have an interest in trying to build a bridge to the jerk. He decides to leave a retaliatory note this morning and it was basically hogwash trying to bully me into hiding in my room all day like him making distant grasps at applying the lease to things that don't really apply, the note culminates into a threat about tattling to the landlords, I sent it to the landlords with my response because he's just trying to be a bully and it's pathetic. \n\nEdit: I'm sure no one is really as invested in this as me because obviously these kind of posts are gonna pop up every August/September but this situation is crummy. I know I called the guy antisocial but he does leave the apt and seem to have something resembling a social life, and I wouldn't be surprised if this post has shown up on the guys feed. In reflection I've definitely tried my best to be nothing but overly nice and patient with the guy so he probably felt blind sided by the landlords getting involved but after flushing his turds four times now and him just getting mad that doing this frustrates me immensely idc, Im just updating because I still get notifs from people sharing a lot of advice ranging from great to clear instigation.

    "title": "My hair is ruined until 2026, thank you Bernadette\u2019s Barbershop\u2026",
    "body": "Before I talk about talk about the haircut itself, I want to mention I have never written a review before. I have never experienced service anywhere that (in my mind) warranted a review so stellar or poor that I had to write about it on yelp, Reddit, etc. That being said, it would be a CIVIL DISSERVICE to not talk about this.\n\nI really care about my hair, and I like to do research and due-diligence before getting haircuts. My hair is a little unique and so I always have more than one picture to show a barber or hairdresser to give them an idea of what I am looking for. Being out of state, I have an amazing hairdresser back home and almost always gotten my haircut with her because she does such an amazing job. However, it has been awhile since I\u2019ve gotten a haircut so I figured I would go to a local barbershop to trim my hair a bit. (THIS PROVED TO BE A MASSIVE MISTAKE!) I looked online and found Bernadette\u2019s Barbershop, they had some pretty stellar reviews so I decided to book an appointment. When I got there I met my barber, she was admittedly pretty nice and thoughtful which proved to be the ONLY positive take away from my experience. I showed her two images, one of which was my previous haircut and the other was a photo I found online that looked extremely similar. I expressed that I really liked my previous haircut, and would like to get something extremely close to what I had with only one small change. She seemed to understand and began to cut my hair.\n\nWe talked a bit during the haircut, usual barbershop chatter, but then I started noticing how long the haircut was taking. I had really only planned on being there for about 20-30 minutes, especially since I had made sure to EXPLICITLY mention that I liked my hairstyle only one month ago. After about a half hour of only cutting the JUST back of my hair, my barber then asked if I previously had an undercut, and explained to me that I had a lot of volume that she did not anticipate. I proceeded to show her the reference images again, detailing once again that I had APPRECIATED the previous haircut and was not looking for a drastic change. She then criticized my hairstylist back home, citing an unusual choice in \u201cbalancing\u201d my hair, which I found very strange considering that I told the barber who is ACTIVELY 45 minutes into cutting my hair that I LIKED MY OLD HAIRCUT and did not want a major change. Time went on, 45 minutes to 60, 60 minutes to 75, as time went on I just got quieter and quieter, trying to trust the vision of the barber and be patient for the final result. In the end, I was in the chair for 84 minutes. I was devastated. The barber mentioned that I should come back in 4-5 months for a cleanup cut (which by the way, if you\u2019ve ever heard this you know your haircut is botched). I apologized to the barber for taking up so much of their time and that it was not my intention (which is entirely true, since I was by no means expecting a massive haircut). Paid slightly extra for the longer haircut (they decided to waive the fee for washing my hair since they did not get the opportunity to in the 84 MINUTES I was in the chair), and went home.\n\nI look completely unrecognizable and feel naked without my hair, this haircut isn\u2019t just one I didn\u2019t want, it\u2019s objectively terrible. My curly hair now looks almost entirely dead and curls above the eyebrows while a faux tail that barely resembles a mullet makes my hair look incredibly imbalanced the barber had combed my hair forward into a triangular shape to give the deception that my hair was longer than it actually was, and after taking a shower I realized that she had cut off easily 3-3.5 inches in the front. I had worked several months growing my hair out and had finally settled on a haircut that suited me and made me feel confident. Now I have to wear hats and bandanas of shame for the next 3-4 months until my hair grows back and I have an opportunity to book my hairstylist from home to settle for a haircut that I don\u2019t want but looks at least good enough that I can walk around without a hat.\n\nI discussed the incident my parents and friends who were in awe of how awful my haircut was, I originally was not convinced to write a review but everyone who saw my hair encouraged me to. I have since washed my hair and the longer I look at it the less confident I feel. Please do not make the same mistake as me, do not go here under any circumstance. I did not ask for anything ambitious, I made my intentions crystal clear and I will now spend the next half year growing my hair out. Do not be stupid. Do not go to Bernadette\u2019s.",

I had an ok experience. They gave me an extra long scalp massage (which was very relaxing) while I was getting my hair washed. I asked if that was usual standard for this shop. Apparently it was because the stylist I was supposed to be with overbooked herself and needed extra time to finish up another client's hair. I appreciated that I was given this over just sitting in the front waiting lol. Anyways, my stylist frees up and moves on to me. I ask for \\~6 inches off (I wanted a big chop) and just for a straight cut across (no layers, etc.). I have pretty straight hair. She does the haircut and spends about an hour on it (a long time for such a simple cut). Tbh I basically zoned out for the cut, and when she was done, I didn't really give it a second thought. I don't remember what I paid, but I do remember having a little bit of sticker shock when I handed over my card... I ended up getting home and my roommate at the time said she couldn't even tell I got it cut. I was confused and when I went to the mirror to check, she was right. I had gotten maybe an inch cut off when I had asked for a significant change. I felt silly about paying so much for so little to be done. After that, I decided not to return. A few weeks later, I got like 8 inches cut off from my hometown salon (out of state). Appears like this is the opposite issue with what you experienced, which seems crazy that they just don't listen. Now, and after many fails with several other salons, I have little trust in trying different/new hair salons in general. I hope your hair stylist from home is able to give you something you are satisfied with and that you can eventually return to a hair style that you feel confident in! My current roommate (who has curly hair) went to Eclectic earlier this semester and was fine with what they did for her. I also think that you should post your review if you haven't already -- it feels as though their ratings are inflated by tons of 5 stars and no real feedback.",

I initially applied for the engineering program but instead got placed into Exploratory Studies.\n\nWhen selecting my classes, my SAT and ALEKS were not high enough to be placed into Calc I (despite the fact I took AP Calc AB in high school, but just didn't submit my score), so I instead got placed into Pre-Calc. Because of the low scores as well, I was unable to register for any fundamental engineering courses and instead was placed into Engineering Technology. I've known since the beginning that I've wanted to do Electrical Engineering, but when I talked to my advisor a few days ago, he said that the standards here are so high, that it may not be a viable choice for me. The problem here is that I KNOW I want to do Electrical Engineering, and even my advisor said the Junior and Senior year courses would be PERFECT for me.\n\nWhat should I do? I talked to my parents and we're considering transferring after the first semester ends, if there's no other option for me.\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you guys so so so much for the advice! I'll definitely stick to the program here at Purdue, and work towards transferring into FYE instead of directly into EE. I think I just needed some reassurance that I wasn't the only one who's had to do this before. It's also reassuring to know that college DEFINITELY is not like high school, and there are a lot of different paths for me to achieve my goal. \n\nI especially appreciate all of those who were telling me to stick here at Purdue! I'm the first one in my family to be attending a big college like this, and I guess my nerves just got the better of me. ",

        "body": "Hi, there's a chance I might your advisor (Nate)! Sometimes when I speak with students, I feel like my words might be misinterpreted, or something gets lost along the way via miscommunication or misunderstanding. Regardless, here's what I'd tell my student in this scenario.\n\nYou should absolutely try for First-year Engineering next semester. If you were not able to take typical FYE courses in your first semester due to not being calc-ready, then it makes sense to \"test drive\" engineering technology in your first semester while you complete MA 158: Pre-Calculus. Next semester, you'll be able to take engineering-level math and science courses. As long as you do reasonably well in them, you absolutely can get into FYE. I've had countless students get into FYE after their second semester after building up their math skills in the fall semester.\n\nThat said, as advisors, we cannot *guarantee* that students will get into their first-choice engineering major - especially if it's one of the more competitive engineering majors. My concern is that when students hear that, they interpret it as \"It's nearly impossible to get in,\" which absolutely isn't the case. But yes, there is always a *possibility* that students cannot get into the engineering major they want (thus, it might not be viable). Traditionally, Electrical Engineering hasn't been as competitive as Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical. But Electrical and Computer have been increasingly more competitive over these past couple of years. As such, you'll want to have as high a GPA as possible in FYE to increase the chances that you get your first-choice major. If you have at least a 3.2 GPA, then you are guaranteed your first choice major if you T2M in May. Still, despite the rising popularity of ECE majors, the major is large and can accommodate many students (as opposed to say...Biomedical Engineering, which is traditionally very small). Thus, if you successfully CODO to FYE and complete the FYE curriculum with reasonably okay grades, then I think your odds of getting into Electrical are very realistic.\n\nIf your goal is Electrical Engineering, and you want to remain at Purdue, then why not give it a shot? Then, if you aren't able to get into FYE after the spring semester, you can reassess whether you 1) want to try for FYE again after the summer, or 2) transfer. Likewise, if you get into FYE but are not offered your first-choice engineering major, then perhaps consider transferring.\n\nHowever, I do want to reemphasize something that is discussed in EDPS 105: there are often many ways to get to the same end goal. If your goal is to be an engineer in a certain industry, there are likely other engineering majors that can still get you there. The aerospace industry has electrical engineers, computer industry has materials engineers, and so on. This [engineering overlap chart](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/Academics/Undergrad/FYE/major-overlap-table) that uses real Purdue graduate destination data illustrates how Purdue engineers aren't pigeonholed into one field. \n\nFor example, let's say you get into FYE but aren't offered Electrical or Computer Engineering, but you instead get into Materials Engineering. You can complete your major, do the semiconductor and microelectronics concentration, and still end up in an electrical engineering type of role within a company.",

Please remember that they publish all exams for the last 5+ years for certain classes on the Purdue website and so it doesn\u2019t even mean that a student will pass the classes even if those exams are given to you. The engineering school doesn\u2019t let students pass a class for trying even after taking a class for the third time around.  This is not to scare anyone, but it\u2019s difficult for most people.

Senate Bill 202 \n\nRef 1: \u201cAmends the duties of state educational institutions' diversity committees. Provides that certain offices or individuals established or employed by a state educational institution (institution) regarding diversity programming must include within the mission of the office or position programming that substantially promotes both cultural and intellectual diversity. Establishes various requirements and restrictions for institutions regarding free inquiry, free expression, and intellectual diversity that does the following: (1) Requires the establishment of certain policies regarding: (A) disciplinary actions for certain persons that materially and substantially disrupt protected expressive activity\u201d\n\nRef 2: \u201c (C) disciplinary actions that will be taken if, after a review, a determination has been made that a tenured faculty member has failed to meet certain criteria related to free inquiry, free expression, and intellectual diversity. \u201c\n\nRef 3: \u201c(3) Requires the establishment of a procedure that allows students and employees to submit complaints that a faculty member or contractor is not meeting certain criteria related to free inquiry, free expression, and intellectual diversity and establishes requirements regarding the procedure and submitted complaints.\u201d\n\nAre these policies vaguely worded and can they be abused? Possibly. Do we know every single detail of the story? Absolutely not. \nThere could\u2019ve been additional reports about conduct within the university by students about faculty- the facts are we don\u2019t know. Subsequent investigation could\u2019ve revealed this effecting the environment for students. The students are meant to disagree, not the professor/staff due to power differential and potential issues it could cause. This is an issue that I have personally seen take place where students with different political ideologies are targeted and discriminated against which is bullshit. \nAnd remember, if it can be weaponized against your enemy, you are not exempted either. (Addressing Ref 3) \n\nRef 2 states possible repercussions that (to my understanding) was briefed to professors once this bill was passed. The standard and expectation was established by the university. (I know IU did this, I\u2019m assuming Ball State and other institutions would do the same due to it directly impacting their employees) \n\nNow to the big one\u2026 Ref 1\u2026\n\nTo preface, I think it is very clear that she made the attempt to stand on the graves of dead childeren in order to either downplay/justify a political assassination when working on a COLLEGE CAMPUS which is the SAME environment where the assassination took place, which, has additional implications and further complicates her statement.\n\nTo pretend she wasn\u2019t backhandedly justifying the assassination is down right delusional, she knew what she was doing, she\u2019s a grown ass woman, now here\u2019s where the argument lies. To even insinuate that a political assassination was at all justified gives students reasonable belief that this particular professor/staff does not promote free speech or discourse amongst students, not to mention that she literally works in the SAME environment where the shooter was allegedly radicalized (while attending college) whether if you believe that or not, it\u2019s what\u2019s documented and what current evidence says. \n\nIn conclusion: I don\u2019t agree with cancel culture, no matter how disgusting of a belief because intellectual safety and echo chambers is what is killing the American youth. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask a random college student on a issue that they claim to be passionate about and I bet you hear the same talking points and no real conclusions, solutions, genuine insights or additional research. \nWith this being said, I am conflicted because I believe\nthe university (or any business/institution/non-profit for that matter) reserves the right to fire people who might not align with their mission statement, with this however, its law, not judgement, I also believe overstepping as a staff member could negatively impact the development of the student and there should be boundaries on what our educators can promote to the students (if it ain\u2019t in the book, shut the fuck up, I ain\u2019t paying for your opinion). The issue gets further complicated when you consider she is a state employee and like it or not, is a representation of the government. \n\nI would say the SAME thing if a professor said something similar about Melissa Hortman and I\u2019m willing to bet a lot of the people outraged could not honestly say the same. Guys, we all need to start being more open minded, realistic, and sensible, because this whole demonizing bullshit and constant insinuation of violence is nothing short of immature, embarrassing, and barbaric.",

Although I'd feel a LOT of people have valid wrongful dismissal cases.That's not the point. The point is. Did Obama, Biden, Bush, or Clinton personally call for people to be fired over politics? When people got fired for saying shit. It was usually along the lines of vocalizing hate crimes and the like. Actually violent speech. This person said nothing alarming or violent. They lost their job for political reasons. The AG of their state encouraged others to rat on their co-workers. This isn't dudes ranting about \"pussys needing a mask\" and losing his job at a donut shop. This was incredibly mild political commentary from someone working in higher education. If you want to \"it's not technically illegal\" yourself into actually fucking thought crimes being a real thing. Go for it. Of course they're not going to just dissolve the first amendment that'd be obviously evil. They're just gonna strip it back, relaying on doffuses like you to justify it. Either you're happy people are getting fired, or you're super autistic and can't understand context and nuance. Either one kinda disqualifies you atm from having a honest conversation about this and it's so frightening because you're exactly the loser that'll lead us to the dark ages.

And you guys are going \"how does it feel!\" Because you are all morons working off a single fucking brain cell. All you can think about is revenge and petty shit. Instead of focusing on helping the world or each other. You instead decided to be dicks back because your feelings were hurt. There's a bear outside of the cave, and it's your turn to stand guard.

During the Revolutionary War, the British tried to remove firearms from the citizens when they feared a revolt was coming and the original creators of the Constitution established the 2nd Amendment to keep the government from taking citizen's rights away. They are less inclined to want to do that if they know citizens will fight back. Its also why America hasnt been invaded. Japan said it best \"there is a gun behind every blade of grass.\"\n\nSo will the 2nd Amendment ever go away? Probably not.

If you have a car, driving around and calling numbers posted for rent for info isn\u2019t a bad shout either. There are also websites where you can look at individual listings, or Facebook marketplace. Don\u2019t be opposed to a house either! A lot of the houses up off Northwestern close to the aviation building have the same/lower rent per person than apartments in the Chauncey area, for more space and privacy.\n\nIn my experience though, if you want furnished apartment you\u2019re looking at closer to 800-1k monthly. Honest to god though, a cheap bed frame, mattress, desk, and fabric drawer dresser will be less than $400 one time if you shop right, and although it\u2019s a big upfront cost it saves so much money in the end. Thrift stores and amazon my dude.\n\nI wish you the best, but unfortunately, the housing situation here doesn\u2019t really allow for you to be picky about getting exactly what you\u2019re looking for unless you get lucky.",

        "body": "I'd argue that while understanding how to study effectively is important, it's equally important to establish good habits. Copying and pasting a response for another student that I wrote a while back, as some of it might be relevant. (warning... long)\n\nHere's some advice I give to my students, as well as things I've observed from students who do well academically.\n\nCommon things I've observed from students with high GPAs include:\n\n* They attend class, regardless of whether or not its required.\n\n* They have a routine. They tend to wake up and go to bed at fairly consistent times. They have a loose routine, whereby each Monday is roughly the same. Each Tuesday is roughly the same, and so on. For example, they'll consistently go to certain spots after certain classes to study/do homework - like going to Hicks Library for a couple hours after their PHYS 172 recitation.\n\n* They have a way of keeping track of their assignments, and they refer to it often. This could be a physical planner, Google/Apple calendar, or whatever else works for them. The key is to just have a system that you'll actually use and stick with it.\n\n* They dedicate a portion of their time at the beginning of the week to assess the week ahead and plan accordingly.\n\n* They actually utilize resources that are available, such as going to office hours, attending SI sessions, and going to help rooms. Often times, the students who need the most help are the ones who are most resistant to seeking help.\n\n* They take practice exams under the same conditions as real exams (i.e. timed, no calculator/single-line calculator, don't look up answers), assess their strengths and gaps in knowledge, then focus on areas they need to improve on using something like [BoilerExams](https://www.boilerexams.com/courses).\n\n* They tend to focus on actually understanding the whys and hows of concepts rather than merely completing homework assignments.\n\n* They are involved with extracurricular activities and are generally engaged with things outside of class - even if it's just stuff for fun.\n\nAdditional pieces of advice based on what I wrote above:\n\n* Have a clear and measurable goal of how you want to improve your time management and organization. Don't just say you're going study more or be more organized. It needs to be specific. Otherwise you have no metric for success. For example, let's say you want to increase your study/homework time to 27 hours per week outside of class. You could break that down into 3 hours per day, or two 90-minute study sessions daily. Then you want to look at your time grid and consider when you'd want to fit those two 90-minute study sessions in for each day of the week. Once you do that, write it down or have some kind of highly visible reminder to help keep yourself accountable.\n\n* I mentioned earlier about the importance of focusing on understanding concepts rather than just completing assignments. To expand on that, Purdue engineering courses often punish students for merely following steps and sequences or plugging numbers into an equation. You've probably noticed that your exams often don't look like what you did on your homework and quizzes. This is by design. You'll likely need to manipulate an equation into something you can work with before solving it. But to do that, important to actually understand the underlying concept of *why* you're doing what you're doing.\n\n* If you're struggling in calculus, it's possible that you need to brush up on your algebra skills. This goes in line with my last point, as you'll often need to manipulate an equation with algebra quickly to see if the equation fits the product rule, quotient rule, or whatever... If you can't do that, you'll probably spend too much time on exams wondering whether you're going down the right path to a solution. TL;DR: you need to be comfortable with using algebra to manipulate equations quickly into a form you can work with. This comes with repetition and working on problems over and over again.\n\n* Implement a basic study cycle, which consists of the following: 1) preview material before going to lecture, 2) go to lecture and take notes, 3) review your notes within 24 hours of taking them. This gives you three separate touch points with the material in a short amount of time, which will help you retain knowledge. Previewing material shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. The point of previewing material isn't to understand everything, but rather to prime your brain to receive information more effectively during lecture. In engineering, it could be looking at notes and watching some videos on ChenFlix, review some problems in BoilerExams, or reading chapter titles/headings/subheadings, bolded keywords + definitions, and chapter summaries in your text book. Previewing material will also help you take better notes in class because you'll already have a vague understanding of what's important and how the information is organized.\n\n* Use the [Feynman technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE), which basically says that if you can teach a concept to someone else, you probably understand it well enough to replicate it on an exam, as it exercises the same call and response part of your brain needed on tests. The key is to teach it OUT LOUD. If you don't have anyone to teach concepts to, you can teach a pet or even an inanimate object. It must be done out loud though. Teaching a concept out loud will quickly reveal whether you truly understand something or not.",

    "body": "What's good fellow boilers,\n\nI want to make this post as a reminder to all those out there struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts to know you aren't alone. As a senior, I am a person who has struggled with depression for many years, and has had to deal with it all of college. As I write this I am currently spiraling into another episode with dark thoughts and ideas of suicide, but I just really want to let y'all know that whatever you are currently struggling with that there are others who probably feel the same way. I am eternally cooked because I have no internships or experience which makes me extremely anxious and depressed about my future, and it also has me wondering why I ever went to college to appease others when I knew the trades were something more up my alley. I smile and mask my pain from others, I suffer in silence like many, I never try to go out with friends, I don't do anything right, but even when I feel like I don't deserve to be on this planet, I remember that I, like many other students, struggle with the same feeling. While we don't have all the answers right now and wherever our paths diverge and life leads us, just know others are probably going through the same thing. Our experiences are different, but the feelings we hold are what give us a commonality, I just wanna express that you are worthwhile, even if it doesn't feel like it. Keep fighting on, and I know how old that saying goes, even I hate hearing it, but its the truth, don't let this current state of our lives make us commit a grave mistake. Just know if you are struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, you mean something to me, because I know what it's like, and I wish things could be better for us. That's all and please reach out to someone even if it feels scary or unnerving, it doesn't matter, sometimes just going out and asking for help is better than just sitting around waiting for our thoughts to consume us. Take care guys, stay safe, know there are people who care. ",

I\u2019ve also got 3 years of solid work experience in the mechanical HVAC industry. While applying for Purdue\u2019s MS in Industrial Engineering, I specifically emailed the graduate admissions office asking whether they accepted PTE scores. They told me yes. I stopped worrying about IELTS/TOEFL and prepared hard for PTE while also juggling GRE prep. I scored 78 overall on PTE and 327 on GRE. Confident, I submitted my application. But then, out of nowhere, I get an email saying PTE is no longer acceptable. I escalated it all the way to the Vice Provost, and the only thing they gave me was a refund form. Since I\u2019m an international student, I had to use the PaymenrWorks portal\u2014and to this day, I still haven\u2019t received the refund. As a backup, I even attempted Duolingo English Test with just 2 days of prep and got 130. Despite all this\u2014good GPA, strong GRE, solid work experience, multiple language test scores\u2014Purdue still rejected me. This whole process feels like a slap in the face. I feel cheated because I relied on what admissions told me, spent my time, effort, and money accordingly, and now I\u2019m left with nothing but wasted months and frustration. \n\nCan anyone please help me what should i do next?",

Don't park anywhere for too long, especially not at a business parking lot during class. \n\n>205 dollars in cash to some shady towing company a 50 minute walk away.\u00a0\n\nWell, J&T isn't exactly shady.

Unfortunately, they never tell you this the day before, so you have to always be on the lookout for statements from Purdue especially if you park in the stadium or corec parking lots. It's pretty messed up.\n\n>A word of advice for any naive undergraduate students who are thinking of bringing a car, please just get off campus housing.\n\nLots of students have off-campus housing and they still can't get a parking permit due to living too close to campus. You either have to live above Grant st. close to Lindberg or live across the bridge to get a C permit. Graduate students/staff have more options thankfully, but it's always been pretty bad. \n\n>Right now I'm praying my car doesn't get towed again I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it.\n\nHonestly, luck here varies wildly from person to person.

We'd prefer to go to Purdue if possible seeing as my band and I are all in our early 20s, recently graduated from college (UW Madison), and enjoy/generally have success playing in college towns. However, I've never been to Lafayette or Purdue and I honestly have no idea what the music scene is like there. So, I'm wondering if anyone on here would have suggestions for venues to play at and/or bands to play with. We typically play venues with a capacity of 500 or less, we love playing DIY venues and house shows (but will play any type of venue honestly), and we play a mix of indie and alternative music, but can get pretty heavy. Basically, we can fit a broad list of genres/styles. Our typical draw is around 100-150 people in Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago. Any help/info on this would be super helpful! Links to my socials and music can be found in this post or on my profile.\n\nLinks:\n\n[Varsity Mac Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3oIAzHK2s4m8Idw2MGIieU?si=1easY1R6Qxy05q1d_jQ3hg)\n\n[Varsity Mac Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/varsity-mac/1556972884)\n\n[Varsity Mac Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/varsity_mac?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MTZmaDgzanJydHpkaQ==)",

One for staff and one for the community. Because, as can be see by Ops response, they stated that the 600 people who signed are all staff. This simply isnt true, This petition has been posted multiple times on here over the last few weeks, non staff members have had the ability to sign it for quite some time, etc.\n\nWhile im sure community sentiment makes a great backup for the points they are making, Purdue if and or when they actually review this, only gives a shit about the sentiment of their own staff members. So fi this petition hits its goal, and someone takes this to Purdue and says, \"Look the staff want change,\" the first thing Purdue is going to do is look at the list of names that signed the petition and say, \"This dosent reflect staff sentiment because there's a bunch of people who signed this that arent staff, you need to show us how many staff members want change.\" After they say that you have to justify to them why it was open to the public and whittle down your data to staff members only anyway and thats usually the point in time a petition dies.",

I had a horrible experience with maintenance that caused me to spend a lot of my own money fixing the mess (literally disgusting like biohazard level mess) and replacing damaged items. I spent $80 on the necessary supplies and hours of my time cleaning.\n\n\n\nI am fairly disappointed by the overall time I have had here, as this is all happening on top of the already subpar experience. I discovered a few carpet beetle larvae as well and will have to spend more money and time to fix that issue. I have paid this rent price before elsewhere and had an immensely better experience. ***I need help finding the emails of higher-ups in the company***. Not leasing@muinzer or anything connected to the Lafayette office such as Kierra's email. I tried to go to the leasing office and felt patronized and dismissed. They recognized the issue was incredibly disrespectful and gross, but said they couldn't do anything and never followed up as they said they would.  \n\n  \nPlease, if anyone can help me find these emails I would really appreciate it.

    "body": "If you have a minute to spare read my post. Might help somebody on here. \n\nTo give some context, I\u2019m an international student. I was always the best student in my high school, the top achiever, always told by my family that I\u2019d go to a great school but here we are in Purdue. A great school especially for my major, but definitely not in the tier of university I thought I would be attending.\n\nIn my first semester, I had to take this chemistry class. It seemed pretty easy, so I never went to the lectures, but I\u2019d go to about half of the labs, mainly because I thought it was fun and a way to take my mind off other classes (math). I was doing well in the tests, always above 85% and I thought that coupled with my homework scores I could get somewhere around a 90 so maybe a B or an A, I wasn\u2019t sure. Took the final, thought I did good and started waiting for the grades. I got my report and it said that I got an F. I was very stunned to say the least and sent an email to my professor because I thought it was a typo. Apparently, every lab I missed after the first 3 skips was a deduction of half a letter grade. So there I was, sitting in my bed and completely lost. This \u201cTA\u201d that I had for my lab section would notice me in class, call me by name, and make small talk with me, and somehow never told me a single thing about how by the 9th week of the term, I had already automatically failed the class. \n\nAt the time I didn\u2019t know who to blame but in the end the answer was me. I had never been in this big of an academic fuckup, so I was depressed for the entire winter holiday. \n\nNow it\u2019s many years later, and I still remember how I felt that night. Just completely lost. Yes I bedrotted for weeks during that winter break but I ended up bouncing back. Actually READING the syllabus of my class, (trying) going to every lecture no matter how boring it is, and not underestimating how big of a difference there is between high school and a college setting. \n\nIf you\u2019re that person that\u2019s been academically ahead your whole life without putting much effort into honing your discipline, know that one day your carelessness catches up to you. I feel that it\u2019s not all bad though, whatever fucked up situation you might be going through you pass by 20 people everyday in a worse one.\n\nAtleast it was a learning experience. (I\u2019m sorry for the yap, and yes I\u2019m still very salty about that F, but better because of it)",

I wanted players to get a real feel for why higher education is so expensive, and how at the end of the day it all boils down to economic incentives. I have thirteen years of experience in the industry and have woven the theme throughout every mechanic, every building, every member of staff in the game. It is part love letter and part critique, while remaining a high-quality European-style board game first and foremost. \n\n[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dietzfoundation/academia/](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dietzfoundation/academia/)\n\nI am hoping to run some games locally during the Kickstarter campaign, but have not set those up yet. If anyone has good ideas for groups who would like to learn to play from the designer on a prototype, let me know! For now I plan on reaching out to the Purdue board game club and the Sage's Shoppe. \n\nThanks for checking it out, and feel free to ask me anything about it!",

The game does not call this out as ridiculous in any way, even though I think that's most people's first reaction to the concept. The building generates a ton of positive Student Experience, which in turn lets you charge more in tuition and earn prestige for how large your student body gets. So whether you think it is ridiculous or you think that's a nice amenity for students, you're making decisions about it based on how good it is for your university in your current situation.

The implications from that, I'd assume, are that if you're denied your first-pick engineering major, you'll be denied for your second-pick engineering major too, because you're being denied from the whole college of engineering.

    "body": "Students in the Motorsports and Mechanical engineering dual degree were met with harsh news this week, with Purdue Indianapolis declaring that the dual degree they've been working for no longer exists. That means that everyone must choose a direction, and lose all the classes they've already taken from the plan of study they don't choose. Multiple of my peers have expressed the same sentiment as me, that we only took a shot at a new campus and new program because of the opportunity to pursue both motorsports and mechanical engineering at the same time.\n\nThis fits with the theme of the past two years at Purdue Indy, false promises and neglect. From major classes that don't exist yet to an abysmal lack of staff, new students shouldn't believe in the smoke and mirrors Purdue throws to promote Indy. It's been a sobering experience to realize just how little they actually care about their students, choosing to pick profits and convenience rather than supporting the very classes they promised.\n\nThe day Purdue makes a campus in Indy will be a great one, but that day is not today. The idea of having one of the best engineering schools deep in the city of Indy is perfect, the ability to make the city your campus as they say in their marketing, but that will only come if Purdue starts taking Indy seriously. That day will only come if Purdue puts their full stride into their one big step into Indy.\n\nUntil then I and many other students remain disappointed and wait for a real Purdue campus in Indy.\n\nUntil then.\n\n  \nEdit: Today Chris Finch met with my motorsports seminar and a student asked about the cancelled dual major. Apparently the dual major was still being discussed with the Purdue academic counsel until the end of summer this year, where they made the decision to not offer it and to not honor any of the students who had already taken classes from both majors (Finch was on the right side of history here and was the only one to vote for the PROMISED dual major to actually happen). \n\nNot only did Purdue advertise a degree option that wasn't approved, they CONTINUE to advertise it, with multiple sources of Purdue media referencing a 5 year dual degree for mechanical and motorsports (See the course registrar for one such example).\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, they haven't even conclusively decided on the 4+1 program for a mechanical masters. Given that they can't even provide classes in Indy, the idea of suddenly being able to support a masters program is laughable. \n\nI was waiting to make my mind fully up about this until I got all the facts. I wished it wasn't true and I was misunderstanding something. But this is well and truly bullshit.\n\nIt's fucked up.\n\nI hope more people can see this side of Purdue Indy and avoid making a huge mistake in their life and their education. \n\nAnd for students reading this in Purdue Indy, don't let this go.\n\nAnd don't forget:\n\nThey don't give a fuck about you.",

And none of those fall on the program, but on Purdue as a university, and in some ways, the school of Mechanical Engineering. \n\nTo elaborate more on what OP is talking about, for the students who have been doing the dual bachelors degree program, nothing changed. Actually, for any legacy students who were enrolled before the split between IU and Purdue, nothing has really changed. However, OP came in at probably the worst possible time to start as a student (because nobody\u2019s denying the students have suffered majorly from the divorce of the universities). Nobody at Purdue West Lafayette wanted to take the time to do any onboarding for IUPUI employees, which everyone really needed for the drastically different purchasing, grading, communications, etc. systems that exist at any large company. After all, any university is just a company. \n\nThe \u201cteachout\u201d students (those existing before Fall 2024) are not being forced to do anything or choose anything differently. Unless you fail a class that will not exist after that semester anymore because it doesn\u2019t exist in the new program (happens with any program being rolled over into Purdue\u2019s system from IU). The main reason for the abrupt changes, most of which are actually just growth, adding more classes, updating existing classes per industry advisory board, and adding new classes, comes from the Motorsports Engineering program becoming part of the Purdue School of Mechanical Engineering. The enrollment was also not allowed to be capped per the College of Engineering (in charge of the school of mechanical engineering, it\u2019s a difficult thing to explain) and they did some shady things to bump enrollment on the Indy campus for their fledgling year as a separate entity, so enrollment in the motorsports program skyrocketed by over 40 students (big number for the usual size of the program being around 80-100). The university wouldn\u2019t listen to any of us trying to tell them we don\u2019t have the capacity for such rapid growth. \n\nAdd to all this there\u2019s zero connection between the two campuses (Indy and West Lafayette) but West Lafayette is trying to run the Indy campus, especially with a program they always let us run completely autonomously, they have no idea how to handle the program and they\u2019re only now starting to realize it and realize how much they screwed everyone on the Indy campus. \n\nAs for plans and direction, the program needs to level out in our new facility at Dallara and figure out some things on campus with simulators and some other small labs. The majority of activity will eventually be aimed at Dallara\u2019s facility in Speedway since we have a large presence there purpose built for us. But we\u2019re still moving in and it\u2019s a mess as the moment in every way. That\u2019s all because of construction headaches. But we\u2019ll be rolling out a new partnership with MUNER in the Italian Motor Valley, more with Dallara, some projects with Arrow McLaren, new car builds from the ground up, manufacturing teaching on new CNC machines, more engaging opportunities to learn CAN coding and telemetry, damper engineering, engine engineering, electronics engineering and design, etc. both through new partnerships and with more access to money through Purdue and new donors. \n\nI have an IndyCar championship ring, an Indy 500 ring, I\u2019ve helped develop parts and systems for Indycar, Cadillac on the LMDH car, helped start big and small companies in racing aftermarket, worked in 1500 horsepower race/street engine development and product development at DSR, worked as a COO for a large engine company and an electronics company, worked with OEMs, etc. and have hundreds of industry contacts with huge names and pedigrees. All of that I worked for but it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Chris Finch and the Motorsports Engineering program. \n\nLong explanation and I know it\u2019s still a little vague, but I\u2019m happy to answer more specific questions. It\u2019s still very bumpy but we\u2019re working every day to make it better for students. In the end, it will all be amazing. For now everyone is feeling the pain, believe me. I completely understand everything OP is saying and feeling. It\u2019s all fair to say and it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard it in the past year.

In one class I assisted with (attendance was not required), we had 60 students enrolled. An average of 20 would show up for lecture. A lot of students will think they'll do well in the class just reading the lecture slides, and they absolutely do not do well. The prof didn't want to require attendance but said he probably will next time because of how poor attendance was.\n\nI agree with the viewpoint that students are adults and can make their own choices on showing up for the class they're paying for. But I also understand the prof's viewpoint as well. Students (statistically speaking) do better when they attend. There are always exceptions but in general this is true. When a professor sits down for a review, they are judged on their students' performances. Saying \"students didn't show up\" isn't going to matter to a committee. \n\nThere isn't an easy answer to this. Let students fail? Maybe, but then then the professor takes the blame for it. Students should be given grace for illness, but if they implement a lenient sick policy, students will take advantage of this and lie. \n\nI understand the frustration in being subjected to rules that feel unfair to you.

It absolutely sucked having a 6pm class with required attendence when I was on fumes and had to watch the recordings anyways in the morning because I retained nothing. It wasted twice as much of my time. \n\n- It's hard to engage with professors in earlier classes. Most just lecture and don't take questions. Some classes in my time had hotseat but half the time the professor never even looked.\n\n- Wearing a mask is not going to do anything if a sick person is right next to you without one. If you have poor vision / get distracted easily and prefer to be at the front of the lecture hall then its a lot harder to avoid being next to a sick person.\n\n- Some professors are terrible lecturers and just mumbled into the mic for an hour. My calc 3 professor while nice was incredibly old and no one could understand him. I substituted the lectures with Chenflix.\n\n- You have a terrible schedule. I had 1 semester where I had to go from my dorm in the morning to the engineering quad, back to hilly's auditorium for a lecture, and then back to the engineering quad with 10m between the 3 lectures. If lectures were recorded for the 3rd class it would have been so much easier to just watch them instead on that day.\n\nBut in all honesty colleges which have stricter attendence policies have sicker student bodies. If you're sick while taking an exam your not going to be at your best and the results will be worse. College students are adults. If they don't want to show up to classes they're spending a fortune on that should be their choice.",

    "title": "Questions Regarding Brightspace + Rants",
    "body": "I'm a freshman in FYE this year and I'm nearing my wits end with Brightspace. I have a few questions that are somewhat answerable, with a small rant after each.\n\n**Why are the assignments in some of my classes not listed with their due dates in the syllabus?**\n\nAll throughout High school I was told that professors would list their assignments and when they were due to not create any confusion, and also to have an argument against students who say they didn\u2019t know something was due. I have maybe one professor who actually did this, and another professor who has a schedule/calendar easily available. The rest of my professors use Brightspace or other sites for assignment due dates. What makes it even more confusing and annoying is that it shows the availability of assignments. I have to constantly check notifications I get to see if an assignment opened / closed, or if it is actually due, which is worsened by Brightspace\u2019s terrible mobile UI. Every time I click a notification I get on my phone, it opens the app just to give me an error. Why even give me a notification at that point? (I did figure out that I have to sign in with DUO before I click on notification, but even then, it usually kicks me out and puts me on the homepage instead.)\n\n**Why are there assignments due on ulterior sites without the due date explicitly stated on Brightspace as well?**\n\nI am having a hard time keeping track of my assignments because it feels like there are 100 different places I have to check every day to stay on top of my work. I know you can add assignments from Brightspace onto an external calendar, but that still doesn't fix the issue of assignments telling me when they're open.\n\n**Is there a way to make Brightspace not an absolute pain in the ass?**\n\nI used Google Classroom at my High school, which was very user friendly. I used Canvas for some online classes and I thought I hated it, but Brightspace makes me want to Assassin's Creed Leap of Faith off the Bell Tower (No one take this idea, I called dibs first). I would offer up my first born son to Purdue Pete if that meant Purdue would switch to literally any other LMS.\u00a0\n\n**Why does Brightspace make me do the DUO Authenticator every time I sign in?**\n\nI use the same devices every time. If a new device is signed in, it should use the authenticator. My laptop, desktop, and phone already verify me auto entering my password with my finger print (Password for desktop). I do understand it from an IT perspective of security, but I think I\u2019d be more concerned about these grand pianos that every student is getting phished with than someone accessing coursework that has 100% already been run through every LLM, no matter how much a professor says it\u2019s illegal. You wouldn\u2019t steal a car, but people would 100% run these wordy ass assignments through AI.\u00a0\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Brightspace blows and I wish there was more congruency with assignment submission.",

I was having a similar issue with getting a lot of stuff in my calendar for when things become available. I\u2019m using shovel, which does allow you to connect brightspace and I believe I was able to fix it.

So that means the best sports statisticians and AI models that all of the gambling world can muster - who get paid a lot of money to make sure the house wins - all those brains real or not said there's no way Purdue can come within 21 points of USC (because you can't score a half point so 20.5 means there's no push win or lose).  And Purdue beat the odds by only losing by 16 points.  So if you were to have bet on Purdue you would get their actual score plus 20.5 points.  But there was never a 50 point margin expected anywhere.  The first couple teams USC played were garbage - MO State and GA Southern?  Big conference teams (like Purdue and USC) often pay for those teams expenses (like Ball State and SIU) to come play against them for their season openers.  Good way for the big team to pad their schedule and on the away team's side a good way for them to get exposure - and sometimes they are scrappy and win.  (Fresno State / TCU and some others who have beat us opening day - we put some of those guys on the map!",

Having gone through it and wishing that I could go back and tell myself shit in retrospect, I can advise the following:\n\n\n- If there are any TA hours or course-specific tutoring spots (there was a table online that had this mapped out, somewhere within the main Purdue student portal navigation links, but it's been so long that I forget where), then plan in advance as much as possible to attend them and bring up which areas you're weak in or struggling to understand.\n\n\n- The textbook over the C Programming Language may very well cover things with a bit more detail and depth that lectures might not have, and possibly even let you look at matters from a different perspective; you can find a PDF immediately just searching that book's name.\n\n\n- Depending on how much downtime you have between other courses (as the main thing that can fuck anyone over is not being able to juggle each of them well enough), you can open Visual Studio Code and simply mess around in it, following along with examples or exercises to get a direct sense of what topics cover.\n\n\n- If you do not physically train already, you would do well to start. The Co-Rec is free if you're a student, but even if your time is thin, you can still find spots to do pullups and pushups at in between lectures. There is a tree across from the WALC that is ideal for this.\n\n\nI don't have much advice for the loneliness, unfortunately, as that's something I've unhealthily ended up growing fond of. However, I would say that blasting Touhou metal in my ears while lifting was a pretty nice way of disregarding it. Just be sure to properly balance your academic obligations while you're at it.",

I think their apps are still open until this upcoming friday, ik they have a callout on Tuesday in WALC if you wanna check it out. from what I remember this upcoming sem the engineering projects are a robotic arm, a tiny wind turbine to charge your devices, a grand prix car team, and a consulting/supply chain or something project i don't recall that one well. I went to their first callout and they had this IR prep thing and they were actually super helpful and friendly which is what encouraged me to join lol, I'm an international student (not sure if you are as well) but iykyk finding jobs and stuff is a bit tougher but in the callout a lot of them are also international so they helped me with my resume and gave great advice that I used in the career fair and I feel like it helped a lot. i hope this is somewhat what you're looking for!",
